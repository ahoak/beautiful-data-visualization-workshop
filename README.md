# beautiful-data-visualization-workshop

Data Visualization workshop materials for learning design concepts to create beautiful and effective custom visuals.
Learn how to turn simple and complex data into impactful visuals though design techniques aimed to cultivate creativity and maximize data insights. Participants will learn a design methodology that caters towards data goals rather than a tool’s available chart types to create unique and effective data visualizations.

## INTRODUCTION

Often engineers and data analysts feel constrained by a specific charting tool or only feel comfortable with a few chart types. Custom visuals can provide more insight and intrigue than default charts, if implemented correctly.

This workshop shifts participants’ perspective from available-tool-solutions to data-goal-solutions. We will go through the step-by-step design process, showing our own failures and successes while building their own data visualization.

## PROCESS

The workshop is framed around a single scenario:
“You are interested in exploring movie data of the last 20 years to determine if there is a gender gap and what trends related to equality/inclusiveness, if any, are in these movies.”
We will go through the design process as followed:

### 1. Define the Purpose

<ul>
    <li>Who is the audience for this visual?</li>
    <li>What is the goal for this visual?</li>  
    <li>What kind of data do we have?</li>  
    <li>Are we choosing the correct medium?</li>  
</ul>

### 2. Inspiration/Research

Think abstractly on how we deliver this information.
Check out a few of these sources for project inspiration:

    <li>(Jill Hubley)[https://jillhubley.com/]</li>  
    <li>(Shirley Wu)[https://sxywu.com/]</li>  
</ul>
While research, think about how can you apply some of these elements in your work?

### 3. Sketch

Look at examine the data and pick out elements of interest. Try to make several mockups using the following approach:
Examine high level elements such as averages, modes, medians.
Examine low level elements such as how individual element will look. Example:
<img src='https://github.com/ahoak/beautiful-data-visualization-workshop/blob/master/images/workshop_sample1.jpg' alt='data sketch' height="200px" />
There is no wrong way to think about this. Use the research in step 2. to apply creative approaches in display.

### 4. Design in Code

Here are some examples of this data visualized:

<ul>
    <li>(Film Dialogue from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age)[https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/] By Hannah Anderson, Matt Daniels </li>
    <li>(Hollywood's Gender Divide and its Effecto on Films)[https://www.pinterest.com/giorgialupi/] BY lyle Friedman, Matt Daniels, Ilia Blinderman</li>   
</ul>

## DATA

data used in the process is a (forked verson)[https://github.com/ahoak/scripts] of Polygraph's Film Dialogue Dataset by Matt Daniels
The data was combined with publicly available Wikepedia data on each movie and actor name.
